The shared dependencies between the files we are generating could include:

1. `analyzer.py`: This is the main script that will be used to analyze the code in the repository. It will be referenced in the README and the example files. 

2. `Analyzer` class: This class, defined in `analyzer.py`, will be used to create instances of the analyzer in the example files.

3. `analyze_repo` function: This function, defined in `analyzer.py`, will be used in the example files to demonstrate how to analyze a repository.

4. `README.md`: This file will contain instructions on how to use the `analyzer.py` script and the `Analyzer` class. It will reference the example files.

5. `example1.py` and `example2.py`: These files will contain examples of how to use the `Analyzer` class and the `analyze_repo` function. They will be referenced in the `README.md`.

6. `repo_path` variable: This variable will be used in `analyzer.py` and the example files to specify the path to the repository that should be analyzed.

7. `results` variable: This variable will be used in `analyzer.py` and the example files to store the results of the analysis.

8. `usage_instructions` variable: This variable will be used in `README.md` to provide instructions on how to use the analyzer.

9. `example_usage` variable: This variable will be used in `README.md` to provide examples of how to use the analyzer.
