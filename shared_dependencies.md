The shared dependencies between the files "./README.md", "./examples/example1.py", and "./examples/example2.py" could include:

1. Repository Name: The name of the repository is a shared dependency as it will be mentioned in the README file and might be referenced in the example Python scripts.

2. Function Names: If the Python scripts are examples of how to use certain functions in the repository, these function names will be shared between the README and the Python scripts.

3. Variable Names: Any variables that are used in the Python scripts and explained in the README file.

4. Data Schemas: If the Python scripts use certain data structures or formats, these would be shared between the scripts and the README file.

5. Usage Instructions: The README file will contain instructions on how to use the Python scripts, so any command-line arguments or user inputs would be shared between the files.

6. Error Messages: Any error messages or exceptions that the Python scripts are designed to throw could be documented in the README file.

7. Output Formats: If the Python scripts produce output in a certain format, this would be shared between the scripts and the README file.

Please note that as a README.md file and Python scripts, there won't be any shared dependencies related to DOM elements or message names as these are specific to web development and messaging systems respectively.
